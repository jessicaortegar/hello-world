# hello-world
My first repository. A place to practice the basic features of GitHub, store ideas, try new things, etc.

# About me
I am a third-year Ph.D. that was previously dedicated to do experiments on the lab. Now, because of health reasons, I statert to perform experiments on the computer. This is a new world to me, and there is a lot for me to learn, including *python programming* or what in the world is happening on those *DFT calculations* every time I hit execute.
